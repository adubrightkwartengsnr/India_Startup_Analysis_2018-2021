1. **Project Title**:
   Exploring the Indian Startup Ecosystem: A Data Driven Analysis of Funding Trends and Industry Sectors

2. **Description**:
   The Indian startup ecosystem is one of the largest and fastest-growing in the world, with a consistent annual growth rate of 12-15%. As of 2018, India was home to more than 50,000 startups, with 2-3 tech startups being born every day. This vibrant ecosystem is becoming increasingly attractive for investors, startups, and corporates alike.
   As team of data analysts, we are to investigate the ecosystem and propose the best course of action for our stakeholders using the data regarding funding received by startups in India from 2018-2019.
   Therefore, the aim of this project is to perform analysis on the Indian start-ups ecosystem and advice stakeholders to invest on a venture that has the potential of high profit/income.


3. **Technologies Used**:
   The analysis of the Indian Startup Ecosystem using the 2018-2021 funding datasets was done following the CRISP-DM process. It also involved a variety of technologies, programming languages, and libraries to process, analyze, and visualize the data. The following tools were utilized:
4. _Python_: Python programming language was the backbone of the project, used for data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks.
5. _Pandas_ and NumPy: Pandas and NumPy libraries were essential for data manipulation and numerical computations.
6. _Matplotlib and Seaborn_: Matplotlib and Seaborn were employed for data visualization, creating insightful charts and graphs to represent the findings.
7. _Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebooks_: Jupyter Notebooks within the Visual Studio IDE provided an interactive environment for running code, visualizing data, and documenting the analysis process.
8. _Scikit-learn_: Scikit-learn's library SimpleImputer was utilized for imputing null values in the amount column.
9. _SQL_: Structured Query Language (SQL) was used for database querying and data retrieval when needed.
10. _GitHub_: GitHub served as the version control system for the project, enabling collaboration and tracking changes in the codebase.
    These technologies played a crucial role in the successful implementation of the project, providing the necessary tools to analyze and derive insights from the Indian Startup Ecosystem funding datasets.

11. **Data Sources**:
    The data for this project was sourced from different places. The 2018 and 2019 datasets were collected from GitHub via provided links, and the 2020 and 2021 datasets from a remotely secured database using credentials provided by client.

12. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
    The data obtained for the analysis of the Indian Startup Ecosystem from the 2018-2021 funding datasets required extensive cleaning and preprocessing due to various issues such as duplicates, misplaced values, null values, inconsistent variables and values, unnecessary symbols, commas, and full stops. The following steps were taken to ensure that the data was reliable and ready for analysis:
13. _Handling Duplicates_: Duplicates were identified and removed from the datasets to prevent skewing the analysis results and ensure data integrity.
14. _Dealing with Null Values_: Null values were identified and handled appropriately using methods such as imputation, removal, or interpolation to avoid any bias in the analysis.
15. _Correcting Misplaced Values_: Values that were incorrectly placed or categorized were corrected to ensure accurate representation of the data.
16. _Standardizing Variables and Values_: Inconsistent variables and values were standardized to maintain uniformity across the datasets, enabling meaningful comparisons and analysis.
17. _Removing Unnecessary Symbols_: Unnecessary currency and other symbols, commas, and full stops were removed from the data (amount column) to prevent errors in calculations and ensure consistency in the dataset.
18. _Data Formatting_: Data formatting was applied to ensure that all data fields were in the correct format for analysis, including date formats, numerical values, and categorical variables.
19. _Data Transformation_: Data transformation techniques were employed to normalize the data distribution, handle outliers, and prepare the data for statistical analysis and machine learning models.

By implementing these data cleaning and preprocessing steps, the quality and reliability of the datasets were significantly improved, setting a solid foundation for the subsequent analysis of the Indian Startup Ecosystem using the 2018-2021 funding datasets.

6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   The Exploratory Data Analysis phase delved deep into the cleaned and preprocessed datasets of the Indian Startup Ecosystem from the 2018-2021 funding records.
